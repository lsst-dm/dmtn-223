\section{DM resources for user batch} \label{sec:resources}
The requirements and this allocation for this are not very large.
At the time of requirement writing Jupyter nor the notion of a Science Platform existed.
The provision of the RSP has to be done within the allocation of user compute.

\subsection{Compute}
As pointed out in \citeds{DMTN-202} the DM requirements stipulate at least
10\% of compute for user batch.
This is included in the USDF sizing model \citeds{DMTN-135}.
Looking at table 21 in \citeds{DMTN-135} we see a total cores in USDF  at around 15K.
This includes 10\% for users so around 1.3K for user.
The RSP assuming a peak of 500 simultaneous users would need 250 or so of those.
User batch would therefore have about 1K cores depending on load.
This implies the need for a controlled sharing mechanism (\secref{sec:quotas}).



\subsection{Storage}
Table 40 of \citeds{DMTN-135} list all datasets used for sizing,
any user batch processing would have to fit in the science user home space.
There is a margin for other data sets as should be clear from \secref{sec:requirements} agreed user defined products will have to be stored at and served from the USDF.
No requirement was laid down as to what data volume should be allocated.
The sizing model covers about 10\%  (as stipulated for compute) in the Other/Misc data set provision.
