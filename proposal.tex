\section{Proposal} \label{sec:proposal}

Let us assume the resources available are fairly fixed in line with \secref{sec:resources}.
Hence we will need an arbitration committee \secref{sec:arbitration}

We promised some form of user batch which it seems likely will be needed at least initially as many users understand batch processing of images say. By batch here we should be clear we mean a BPS command line interface to something like PanDA. \secref{sec:bpsbatch}

These two items with the RSP fulfill our requirements.  RSP covers a bunch of other requirements on queries and image access \secref{sec:rsp}


\subsection{Science Platform}\label{sec:rsp}
The RSP is now well established
\subsection{Arbitration Committee}\label{sec:arbitration}
\subsection{BPS Batch }\label{sec:bpsbatch}
