We have some requirements on user batch as discussed in \secref{sec:requirements}.
We also have certain resources available at USDF  and development effort as discussed in \secref{sec:resources}.\
\citeds{DMTN-202} gives some desirable use cases.

In this note we rendezvous all of this information and clarify what DM could and will do during construction.
